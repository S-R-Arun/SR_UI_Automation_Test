## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
If you're starting fresh, run:
```
npm init -y
npm i -D playwright typescript ts-node @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### 2️⃣ Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

To run a specific test:
```
npm test tests/login.spec.ts
```
With headed mode:
```
npm test -- --headed
```
🧪 Running Tests in Debug Mode
```
npx playwright test --debug
```

To run only Chromium:
```
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```
🧾 Logging
 - Logs are stored under the /logs/ folder.

 - A new file is created for every run with a timestamp:

Install the logger 
```
npm install winston
```
Log file
```
logs/test-2025-07-28T12-38-07-653Z.log
```
Example log format:

```

[2025-07-28 12:38:07.735] INFO: Navigating to login page...
```
Console logs are also shown during execution.


🔧 Fixtures
   - Fixtures are defined in fixtures/baseFixture.ts to handle:

  - Browser launch
  - Page setup
  - Test-level data or context

🧱 Page Objects
Follow the Page Object Model (POM) pattern:
- Create a class for each page (e.g., LoginPage)
- Include reusable methods for interactions and assertions


## 📊 Allure Reporting

This framework supports **Allure Reports** for beautiful and interactive test results.

### 🛠 Installation

```bash
npm i -D allure-playwright

npm i -D allure-playwright allure-commandline
```

🧪 Run Tests with Allure
```
npx playwright test
```
📈 Generate Allure Report
```
npm run allure:report
```
The report will open in your browser with charts, timelines, and test logs.

🗂 Output Structure
 - allure-results/: Raw results from Playwright

- allure-report/: Final visual report generated by Allure

✨ Customization Ideas
- ✅ Add environment-specific configs
- 🧪 Integrate with CI (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- 📊 Generate HTML reports (playwright-report)
- Allure Report is generated
- 📸 Add screenshot capturing on failure
- 📥 Add API support (via Playwright APIRequestContext)
